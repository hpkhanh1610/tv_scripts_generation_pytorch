# TV Scripts generation with Deep Learning using PyTorch

In this project, I'll generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
